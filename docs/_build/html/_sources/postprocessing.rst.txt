Postprocessing fMRI
===================

When performing functional connectivity analysis, there are several additional processing steps that need to be taken after the minimal preprocessing of fMRIPrep. clpipe implements these steps in Python, and a fMRIprep preprocessed dataset can be postprocessed using the following command: ::

    usage: fmri_postprocess [options] [subjects...]
        options:
            -configFile, Use a given configuration file. If left blank, uses the default config file, requiring definition of BIDS, working and output directories.
            -targetDir, Which fmriprep directory to process. If a configuration file is provided with a BIDS directory, this argument is not necessary.
            -targetSuffix, Which file suffix to use. If a configuration file is provided with a target suffix, this argument is not necessary. Defaults to 'preproc_bold.nii.gz'
            -outputDir, Where to put the postprocessed data. If a configuration file is provided with a output directory, this argument is not necessary.
            -outputSuffix, What suffix to append to the postprocessed files. If a configuration file is provided with a output suffix, this argument is not necessary.
            -task, Which task to postprocess. If left blank, defaults to all tasks
            -TR, The TR of the scans. If a config file is not provided, this option is required. If a config file is provided, this information is found from the sidecar jsons.
            -logOutputDir, Where to put HPC output files. If not specified, defaults to <outputDir>/batchOutput.
            -submit, Flag to submit commands to the HPC.
            -batch/single, submit to batch, or run in current session. Mainly used internally.
        subjects..., A list of subject IDs to process. If left blank, then all subjects are processed.
