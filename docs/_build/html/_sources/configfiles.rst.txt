Configuration Files
===================

Most command line functions in clpipe can take a configuration file in the '-configFile' option. These configuration files are JSONs that contain all aspects of the preprocessing and postprocessing streams that you want applied to your dataset. To create a configuration file for your dataset use the following command::

    grab_config_file -outputFile <adirectory/yourfilename>.json

This command will create a default configuration file with whatever name you specified. The default configuration file looks like this ::

   {
	"ConfigTitle": "Default Configuration File",
	"FMRIPrepOptions": {
		"BIDSDirectory": "",
		"WorkingDirectory": "",
		"OutputDirectory": "",

	},

All of these fields are required and have what the designers of clpipe consider to be reasonable defaults for processing. Additionally, users at UNC-CH on the Longleaf cluster with access to the HNG group should be able to use the default options with no change. Other users will have to modify several fields. We describe the various fields now.

* ``ConfigTitle:`` The title of your configuration file, not used in processing.
* ``FMRIPrepOptions:`` Options regarding fMRIprep.

    * ``BIDSDirectory:`` Your BIDs formatted raw data directory. Use absolute paths if possible.
    * ``OutputDirectory:`` Where you want your preprocessed files to go. Use absolute paths
    * ``FMRIPrepPath:`` Where the fMRIprep Singularity image is.
    * ``FreesurferLicensePath:`` Where your Freesurfer license .txt file is.
    * ``FMRIPrepMemoryUsage:`` How much memory in RAM each subject's preprocessing will use, in Mbs. Default is 20000Mb or 20Gb.

* ``PostProcessingOptions:`` Options for various postprocessing steps.

    * ``TargetDirectory:`` What directory holds your fMRIPrep preprocessed data.
    * ``TargetSuffix:`` What suffix do your preprocessed fMRI NiFTi files have? Default is preproc_bold.nii.gz.
    * ``OutputDirectory:`` Where you want your postprocessed files to go.
    * ``OutputSuffix:`` What suffix do you want appended to your postprocessed files? Make sure to end it with .nii.gz.
    * ``ConfoundSuffix:`` What suffix does the confound regressors file have. Default is confound_regressor.txt.
    * ``Regress:`` True/False. Do you want to perform nuisance regression on the data. Default True. For more info see Postprocessing/Nuisance Regression.
    * ``RegressionParameters:`` These are the headers for the various regression parameters in the fmriprep confound file. The defaults are for the latest fmriprep version. Change only if you are using a much earlier version of fmriprep.
    * ``NuisanceRegression:`` What type of nuisance regression do you want to perform. Default to QuadLagged (33 Parameter Regression). For more information see Postprocessing/Nuisance Regression.
    * ``WhiteMatter:`` True/False. Include mean whitematter signal into nuisance regression. Defaults to True.
    * ``CSF:`` True/False. Include mean cerebral spinal fluid signal into nuisance regression. Defaults to True.
    * ``GlobalSignalRegression:`` True/False. Include global signal into nuisance regression. Defaults to False.
    * ``FilteringHighPass:`` High pass frequency for filtering. Defaults to .08 Hz. For more information on filtering see Postprocessing/Frequency Filtering. Set to -1 to remove high pass filtering.
    * ``FilteringLowPass:`` Low pass frequency for filtering. Defaults to .1 Hz. For more information on filtering see Postprocessing/Frequency Filtering. Set to -1 to remove low pass filtering.
    * ``FilteringOrder:`` Order of filter. Defaults to 12. For more information on filtering see Postprocessing/Frequency Filtering.
    * ``OversamplingFreq``: The oversampling frequency for the spectral interpolation. Defaults to 4. For more information on spectral interpolation see Postprocessing/Spectral Interpolation.
    * ``PercentFrequencySample:`` Proportion (0 to 1, 1 being 100%) of spectrum to use in spectral interpolation. Defaults to 1. For more information on spectral interpolation see Postprocessing/Spectral Interpolation.
    * ``Scrubbing:`` True/False. Use scrubbing. Defaults to true. For more information on scrubbing see Postprocessing/Scrubbing.
    * ``ScrubFDThreshold:`` At what framewise displacement to scrub. Defaults to .3.
    * ``ScrubAhead:`` If a timepoint is scrubbed, how many points after to remove. Defaults to 2.
    * ``ScrubBehind:`` If a timepoint is scrubbed, how many points before to remove. Defaults to 2.
    * ``ScrubContig:`` How many good contiguous timepoints need to exist. Defaults to 4.
    * ``SpatialSmoothing:`` NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.
    * ``PostProcessingMemoryUsage:`` How much memory (RAM) per subject to request, in Mbs. Defaults to 20000Mb or 20Gb.
    * ``PostProcessingMemoryUsage:`` How much time per subject to request. Format is Hours:Mins:Seconds. Defaults to 8 hours.
    * ``NThreads:`` How many CPUs to request. Defaults to 1. Do not modify lightly.
    * ``SpectralInterpolationBinSize:`` How many voxels per bin to work on in spectral interpolation. Increasing this reduces time but increases memory usage. Defaults to 5000.
    * ``BIDSValidatorImage:`` Where the BIDS validator Singularity image is.

* ``RunLog:`` This list contains a record of how a given configuration file is used.
* ``BatchConfig:`` What batch configuration file to use. For more information see For Advanced Users/Batch Configuration.
