Welcome to clpipe: A MRI Processing Pipeline for high performance clusters!
===========================================================================


clpipe was developed to streamline the processing of MRI data using the high performance cluster at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It uses the `fmriprep <https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ for preprocessing fMRI data and implements a variety of additional processing steps important for functional connectivity analyses such as nuisance regression and filtering. Also included in clpipe are a variety of console commands for validation and checking the results of preprocessing. Please report any bugs, issues or feature requests on our Github page.
