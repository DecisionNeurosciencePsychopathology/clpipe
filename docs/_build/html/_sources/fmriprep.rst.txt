Preprocessing with fMRIprep
===========================

clpipe uses `fMRIprep <https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ to perform minimal preprocessing on functional MRI data. To submit your dataset for preprocessing, use the following command: ::

    usage: fmriprep_process [options] [subjects...]
        options:
            -configFile, Use a given configuration file. If left blank, uses the default config file, requiring definition of BIDS, working and output directories.
            -bidsDir, Which BIDS directory to process. If a configuration file is provided with a BIDS directory, this argument is not necessary.
            -workingDir, Where to generate the working directory. If a configuration file is provided with a working directory, this argument is not necessary.
            -outputDir, Where to put the preprocessed data. If a configuration file is provided with a output directory, this argument is not necessary.
            -logOutputDir, Where to put HPC output files. If not specified, defaults to <outputDir>/batchOutput.
            -submit, Flag to submit commands to the HPC.
        subjects..., A list of subject IDs to process. If left blank, then all subjects are processed.

``fmriprep_process`` creates one batch job per subject. If you find that you are running out of memory, increase the `[FMRIPrepOptions][FMRIPrepMemoryUsage]` option in the configuration file.
