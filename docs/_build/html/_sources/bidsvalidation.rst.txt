BIDS Validation
===============

clpipe contains a convenience function to validate your datasets directly on the HPC. This function uses a Singularity image of the `BIDs Validator <https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator>`_. The command to run the BIDs validator is::

    usage: bids_validate [options] bidsDir
        options:
            -configFile, Uses a given configuration file
            -submit/save, Submits the batch command to the HPC, or prints it to screen
            -interactive/batch, Directly calls the command using os.system, or submits it as a batch command. Interactive only works during an interactive session.

``bids_validate`` produces an output file titled `Output-BIDSValidator.out` at your current working directory that contains the output of the BIDS validator.
